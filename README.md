# Pymaceuticals - Analysis through Visualization
In this assignment, the focus is on presenting a compelling narrative using data visualization techniques. Specializing in anti-cancer medications, the analysis applies Matplotlib to convey meaningful insights from a recent animal study involving squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treatments. Let's explore the visual journey through the study results:

### Background
Pymaceuticals, Inc. conducted a study to evaluate potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a common form of skin cancer. Over 45 days, 249 mice with SCC tumors received various drug regimens. The study's primary goal was to compare the performance of our drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.

### Tasks Accomplished
**Data Preparation**
- Merged the mouse_metadata and study_results DataFrames into a single DataFrame for comprehensive analysis.
- Checked for unique mouse IDs and identified duplicate time points. Cleaned the data by removing duplicates.
- Updated the count of unique mouse IDs for accuracy.
  
**Summary Statistics**
Created a DataFrame of summary statistics, presenting mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of tumor volume for each drug regimen.
  
**Bar Charts and Pie Charts**
  
***Bar Charts:***

- Generated bar charts showcasing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen throughout the study.
- Created the first bar chart using the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.
- Generated the second bar chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.
  
***Pie Charts:***

- Created pie charts illustrating the distribution of female versus male mice in the study.
- Created the first pie chart using the Pandas DataFrame.plot() method.
- Generated the second pie chart with Matplotlib's pyplot methods.
  
**Quartiles, Outliers, and Box Plot**
- Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse for four promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin.
- Determined the quartiles, IQR, and identified potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.
- Highlighted potential outliers with distinctive colors and styles in a box plot using Matplotlib.
  
**Line Plot and Scatter Plot**

***Line Plot:***
Selected a single mouse treated with Capomulin and created a line plot depicting tumor volume versus time point for that mouse.

***Scatter Plot:***
Generated a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.

**Correlation and Regression**
- Calculated the correlation coefficient and established a linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.
- Plotted the linear regression model on top of the scatter plot for visual interpretation.
  
### Conclusion
Effective data visualization serves as a powerful tool for conveying complex insights. This visual analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the study results, offering clear narratives for data-driven decision-making in the context of cancer medication research.
